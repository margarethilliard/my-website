Welcome! I'm a third year graduate student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in the [Organismic and Evolutionary Biology program](https://gpls.cns.umass.edu/oeb) working with [Dr. David Sela](https://www.selalab.org/) in the Food Science Department. I'm broadly interested in the evolution of inter-individual differences in human milk composition. Also, how maternal genetics and environmental exposures influence the development of the infant gut microbiome. I use molecular techniques to investigate carbohydrate scavenging in the infant gut commensal Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis. I also use a simplified in vitro model (shown below) of the distal gut microbiome to study how host-indigestible carbohydrates modulate fecal communities.

In my free time I enjoy bouldering, watching horror movies or documentaries, gardening, reading science non-fiction, baking, watercolor painting, and playing board games!

## About My Funding 

>- For my first and last year, I've been generously funded by the Graduate School as a [Spaulding-Smith Fellow](https://www.umass.edu/graduate/inclusion/spaulding-smith-fellows).
>- I am also internally funded by The [Predissertation Research Grant](https://www.umass.edu/graduate/funding/internal-funding) to develop strain-specific RT-PCR primers in order to investigate competitive interactions among coexisting B. infantis strains. 
>- I am currently (Spring 2021) funded as a Teaching Assistant (TA) in the Biology Department and as a Research Assistant (RA) at the [Genomics Resource Labororatory](https://www.umass.edu/ials/genomics) on campus. 
>- Stay tuned for more!
