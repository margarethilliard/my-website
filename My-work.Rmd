## Course work

### Evolutionary Genomics & Bioinformatics (Fall 2020)

Please visit my [EvoGeno repository](https://github.com/margarethilliard/genomics-course) to reproduce any of my course work. 

## Research (coming soon!!!)

### Microplate Growth Data (Fall 2021)

This is a repository containing R Markdown files where I have taken raw microplate data and show you how I transform the data to visualize growth curves, endpoint OD600 readings, and growth rates on different substrates in R Studio.

### Comparative Genomics (Spring 2022)

I did a whole genome sequencing (WGS) run in the Fall of 2021! With all this BIG data, I take you through a journey where I visualize some of my results in R Studio using data from pipelines like [Prokka](https://github.com/tseemann/prokka), [Roary](https://github.com/sanger-pathogens/Roary), and [LS-BSR](https://github.com/jasonsahl/LS-BSR).
