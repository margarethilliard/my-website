## Course work

### Evolutionary Genomics & Bioinformatics

Please visit my [EvoGeno repository](https://github.com/margarethilliard/genomics-course) to reproduce any of my course work. 

## In vitro data 

I'm making a new growth data repository to show some trends I've found that will inform future growth assays. Check back soon.


I'll post the latest updates and news here. Comments are always welcome.
